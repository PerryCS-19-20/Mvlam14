  Hi I'm Michael Vlaming, a senior at Perry High School class of 2017. I have played football and run track every year here. I currently am 
  varsity in both and have lettered in both. I love games anything from consoles to hand-helds to board games.<br> 
  I like to:
<ul>
    <li>Play games</li>
    <li>Play football</li>
    <li>Listen to music</li>
    <li>Hangout with friends</li>
    <li>Watch anime</li>
</ul><br>
  In software engineering I would like to better further my coding knowledge and skill.
